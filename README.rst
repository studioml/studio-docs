Studio is a model management framework written in Python to help
simplify and expedite your model building experience. It was developed
to minimize any overhead involved with the scheduling, running,
monitoring or management of artifacts of your machine learning
experiments in Python without invasion of your code. No one wants to
spend their time configuring different machines, setting up
dependencies, or playing archeologist to track down previous model
artifacts.

Most of the features are compatible with any Python machine learning
framework (`Keras <https://github.com/fchollet/keras>`__,
`TensorFlow <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`__,
`scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`__, etc);
some extra features are available for Keras and TensorFlow.

**Use Studio to:** 

* Capture experiment information- Python environment, files, dependencies and logs- without modifying the experiment code. 
* Monitor and organize experiments using a web dashboard that integrates with TensorBoard. 
* Run experiments locally, remotely, or in the cloud (Google Cloud or Amazon EC2) 
* Manage artifacts
* Perform hyperparameter search
* Create customizable Python environments for remote workers.

Example usage
-------------

Start visualizer:

::

    studio ui

Run your jobs:

::

    studio run myfile.py

You can see results of your job at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Run
``studio {ui|run} --help`` for a full list of ui / runner options

Installation
------------

Installation Packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pip install studioml from the master pypi repositry:

::

    pip install studioml

or, install the source and development environment for StudioML from the git project directory:

::

    git clone https://github.com/studioml/studio && cd studio && pip install -e .

A setup.py is included in the top level of the git repository that
allows the creation of tar archives for installation on runners and
other systems where git is not the primary use case for handling Python
artifacts. To create the installable, use the following command from the
top level directory of a cloned repository:

::

    python setup.py sdist

This command will create a file dist/studio-x.x.tar.gz that can be used
with pip as follows:

::

    pip install studio-x.x.tar.gz

Certain types of runners can make use of the studio software
distribution to start projects without any intervention, devops less
runners. To include the software distribution, add the tar.gz file to
your workspace directory under a dist subdirectory. Runners supporting
software distribution will unroll the software and install it using
virtualenv.

We recommend setting up a `virtual
environment <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`__.

CI/CD pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Studio project distributes official releases using a travis based
build and deploy pipeline. The Travis project that builds the official
github repository for Studio has associated with it encrypted user and
password credentials that the Travis yml file refers to. These secrets
can be updated using the Travis configuration found at
https://travis-ci.com/SentientTechnologies/studio/settings. The
PYPI\_PASSWORD and PYPI\_USER variables should point at an owner account
for the project. To rotate these values, remove the old ones using the
settings page and re-add then same variables with new values.

When code is pushed to the master branch in the github repository, a
traditional build will be performed by Travis. To push a release after
the build is complete, add a server compatible version number as a tag
to the repository and do a 'git push --tags' to trigger the deployment
to pypi. Non-tagged builds are never pushed to pypi. Any tag will result
in a push to pypi, so care should be taken to manage the visible
versions using the PYPI\_USER account.

Release process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Studio is released as a binary or source distribution using a hosted
package at pypi.python.org. To release Studio, you must have
administrator role access to the Studio Package on the
https://pypi.python.org/ web site. Releases are done using the setup
packaging found inside the setup.py files.

When working with the pypi command line tooling you should create a
~/.pyirc file with your account details, for example:

::

    [distutils]
    index-servers=
        pypi
        testpypi

    [testpypi]
    repository = https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
    username = {your pipy account}
    password = {your password}

    [pypi]
    username = {your pipy account}

The command to push a release is as follows.

::

    python setup.py sdist upload

If you wish to test releases and not pollute our pypi production release
train and numbering, please use the '-r' option to specify the test pypi
repository. pypi releases are idempotent.

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the unit and regression tests, run

::

    python $(which nosetests) --processes=8 --process-timeout=600

Note that simply running ``nosetests`` tends to not use virtualenv
correctly. If you have application credentials configured to work with
distributed queues and cloud workers, those will be tested as well.
Otherwise, respective tests will be skipped. The total test runtime,
when run in parallel as in the command above, should be no more than 10
minutes. Most of the tests are I/O limited, so parallel execution speeds
up things quite a bit. The longest test is the gpu cloud worker test in
EC2 cloud (takes about 500 seconds due to installation of the drivers /
CUDA on the EC2 instance).

Authentication
--------------

Both studio ui and studio runner use the same authentication tokens for
a database backend. The tokens are valid for one hour, but if Studio is
running, it renews the tokens automatically.

Note that refresh tokens do not expire; this means you can use these
tokens on multiple machines, e.g. when you want to use a Google account
authentication on a remote server but don't want to open extra ports.
Simply copy the contents of ~/.studioml/keys folder to the desired
machine.

Currently Studio supports 2 methods of authentication: email & password
and using a Google account. To use studio runner and studio ui in guest
mode, in studio/default\_config.yaml, uncomment "guest: true" under the
database section.

Alternatively, you can set up your own database and configure Studio to
use it. See `setting up database <docs/setup_database.rst>`__. This is a
preferred option if you want to keep your models and artifacts private.

Email / password authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an email & password account set up, you can use this method.
In default\_config.yaml, uncomment "use\_email\_auth: true" under the
database section. If the token is not found or expired when you run
studio ui / studio runner, you will be asked for your email and password
for authentication. Note that the password is NOT stored on your
computer (but tokens are), so you will be asked for your password after
an hour of inactivity.

Google account authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have an email & password account set up, don't despair! Any
user with a Google account can use Studio as a first-class citizen. If a
token is not found when you run studio, the Web UI will redirect you to
the Google account authentication app where you will be issued a new
authentication token.
